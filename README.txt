Introduction
============

slc.calendarfetcher provides the ability to import multiple ICS calendar files
(specified by their URLs) into a single Calendar.

By using a cronjob or Zope's clockserver, this can be made periodically
repeatable, ensuring that your Plone calendar is always up to date with the
events from an outside calendar.


Installation:
-------------

slc.calendarfetcher can be installed via the portal_quickinstaller or the Plone
Control Panel's Add-remove products section.

Products.Calendaring is a dependency that needs to be installed manually (for
now).
